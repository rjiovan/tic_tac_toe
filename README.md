# Tic Tac Toe

### Introduction
I have been in a Project Management position for 12 months and have not sat down to code any new projects during that time. I felt that I was becoming removed from the developer way of thinking and the process, so I decided that I will get back into coding by blogging about my projects. In hopes to give back and earn comradery with the developer community. I will start with a few refresher tutorials. For my first project, I chose to lean on Scrimba for a one-hour tutorial on creating a react app that will allow a user to fetch data about a movie.
